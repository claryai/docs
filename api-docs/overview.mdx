# API Overview

The Clary AI API allows you to programmatically interact with the Clary AI platform, enabling you to process documents, manage workflows, and retrieve analysis results.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the base URL of your Clary AI instance:

```
http://your-clary-instance:8080/api/v1
```

If you're using the Docker container with default settings, this would be:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.claryai.com/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

For more information on authentication, see the [Authentication](/api-docs/authentication) page.

## Available Endpoints

Clary AI provides the following main API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/documents` | Upload, process, and retrieve documents |
| `/workflows` | Create and manage document processing workflows |
| `/analysis` | Access document analysis results |

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. A typical response structure looks like:

<CodeGroup>
```json Success Response
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

```json Error Response
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Error message"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Error Codes

Clary AI uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | OK - The request was successful |
| 400 | Bad Request - The request was invalid |
| 401 | Unauthorized - API key is missing or invalid |
| 403 | Forbidden - The API key doesn't have permission to perform the request |
| 404 | Not Found - The requested resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

## Pagination

For endpoints that return multiple items, pagination is supported using the following query parameters:

- `page`: Page number (starting from 1)
- `limit`: Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)

Example:

```
GET /api/v1/documents?page=2&limit=50
```

Response includes pagination information:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "documents": [
      // Document objects
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "total": 157,
      "page": 2,
      "limit": 50,
      "pages": 4
    }
  }
}
```

## API Versioning

The Clary AI API is versioned to ensure backward compatibility. The current version is `v1`.

The version is included in the URL path:
