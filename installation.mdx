## Docker Installation

The recommended way to install Clary AI is using Docker:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Lite
# Pull the Clary AI Lite Docker image
docker pull claryai/lite:latest

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 claryai/lite:latest
```

```bash Standard

docker pull claryai/standard:latest

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 claryai/standard:latest
```

```bash Professional
# Pull the Clary AI Professional Docker image
docker pull claryai/professional:latest

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 claryai/professional:latest
```
</CodeGroup>

## Docker Compose Setup

For production environments, we recommend using Docker Compose:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Lite
version: '3'
services:
  claryai:
    image: claryai/lite:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - CLARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
      - CLARY_STORAGE_PATH=/app/data
```

```yaml Standard
version: '3'
services:
  claryai:
    image: claryai/standard:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - CLARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
      - CLARY_STORAGE_PATH=/app/data
```

```yaml Professional
version: '3'
services:
  claryai:
    image: claryai/professional:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - CLARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
      - CLARY_STORAGE_PATH=/app/data
      - CLARY_CLOUD_LLM_API_KEY=your_cloud_llm_api_key
```
</CodeGroup>

Save this as `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can install Clary AI manually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/claryai/claryai.git
    cd claryai
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Application">
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your configuration
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the Application">
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verifying Installation

To verify that Clary AI is running correctly:

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
2. You should see the Clary AI login page
3. Try processing a document using the API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/api/v1/documents \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -F "file=@/path/to/your/document.pdf"
   ```

## Environment Variables

Clary AI can be configured using the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

<Accordion title="Container fails to start">
Check Docker logs for more information:
```bash
docker logs claryai
```

Common issues include:
- Insufficient memory
- Port 8080 already in use (change the port mapping in your Docker command)
- Missing environment variables
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API connection issues">
If you can't connect to the API:
- Ensure the container is running: `docker ps`
- Check that you're using the correct URL and port
- Verify that your API key is correct
- Check firewall settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Document processing errors">
If document processing fails:
- Ensure the document format is supported
- Check that the document is not corrupted
- Verify that you have sufficient disk space
- Check the logs for specific error messages
</Accordion>
