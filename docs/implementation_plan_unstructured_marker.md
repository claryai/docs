# Implementation Plan: Unstructured.io and Marker Integration

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Unstructured.io and Marker into the Clary AI document processing pipeline.

## 1. Overview

We are enhancing our document processing pipeline with two powerful open-source libraries:

1. **Unstructured.io** - For document preprocessing and parsing
2. **Marker** - For high-accuracy PDF text extraction

These integrations will significantly improve our document processing capabilities, particularly for complex documents and PDFs with challenging layouts.

| 1 | Update dependencies and documentation | Week 1 | Backend Team |
| 2 | Implement DocumentPreprocessor module | Week 1-2 | Backend Team |
| 3 | Implement PDFExtractor module | Week 1-2 | Backend Team |
| 4 | Update document processing pipeline | Week 2 | Backend Team |
| 5 | Testing and validation | Week 3 | QA Team |
| 6 | Performance optimization | Week 3-4 | Backend Team |
| 7 | Documentation and training | Week 4 | Documentation Team |
| 8 | Production deployment | Week 5 | DevOps Team |

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.1 Dependencies

The following dependencies have been added to `requirements.txt`:

```python
unstructured==0.10.30
unstructured-inference==0.7.19
marker-pdf==0.1.5
```

Additional system dependencies have been added to the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
ghostscript
libmagic1
pandoc
libgl1-mesa-glx
libglib2.0-0
```

### 3.2 New Modules

#### 3.2.1 DocumentPreprocessor

The `DocumentPreprocessor` class uses Unstructured.io to:

- Parse documents into semantic elements (titles, paragraphs, lists, tables)
- Normalize document content for consistent processing
- Detect document types automatically
- Provide structured representation of document content

#### 3.2.2 PDFExtractor

The `PDFExtractor` class uses Marker to:

- Extract high-quality text from PDF documents
- Preserve text flow and layout
- Handle complex PDF formatting
- Provide page-by-page text extraction

### 3.3 Updated Processing Pipeline

The document processing pipeline has been updated to:

1. Preprocess all documents with Unstructured.io
2. Use Marker for PDF text extraction
3. Use OCR for image-based documents
4. Enhance layout analysis with Unstructured.io's element classification
5. Provide more context to the extraction agent

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Unit Tests

- Create unit tests for `DocumentPreprocessor` and `PDFExtractor` classes
- Test with various document types and formats
- Validate output structure and content

### 4.2 Integration Tests

- Test the entire document processing pipeline
- Compare results with previous implementation
- Validate improvements in extraction accuracy

### 4.3 Performance Tests

- Measure processing time for different document types
- Compare memory usage with previous implementation
- Identify optimization opportunities

## 5. Expected Benefits

### 5.1 Improved Accuracy

- Better text extraction from PDFs with complex layouts
- More accurate document structure identification
- Enhanced context for extraction agent

### 5.2 Expanded Capabilities

- Automatic document type detection
- Better handling of tables and forms
- Improved extraction of structured data

### 5.3 Performance Considerations

- Potential increase in processing time for initial document analysis
- Improved extraction accuracy may reduce need for manual corrections
- More comprehensive document understanding may improve agent efficiency

## 6. Potential Challenges

### 6.1 Integration Challenges

- Ensuring compatibility between Unstructured.io, Marker, and existing components
- Handling edge cases in document formats
- Managing dependencies and system requirements

### 6.2 Performance Considerations

- Monitoring memory usage with additional libraries
- Optimizing processing time for large documents
- Balancing accuracy and performance

## 7. Rollout Plan

### 7.1 Development Environment

- Implement and test in development environment
- Validate with sample documents
- Address any issues or bugs

### 7.2 Staging Environment

- Deploy to staging environment
- Test with real-world documents
- Validate performance and accuracy

### 7.3 Production Environment

- Gradual rollout to production
- Monitor performance and resource usage
- Collect feedback and make adjustments

## 8. Success Metrics

- **Extraction Accuracy**: Improvement in correctly extracted fields
- **Processing Time**: Impact on document processing time
- **Error Rate**: Reduction in extraction errors
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from users on extraction quality

## 9. Conclusion

The integration of Unstructured.io and Marker represents a significant enhancement to our document processing capabilities. By leveraging these powerful open-source libraries, we can provide more accurate and comprehensive document understanding, ultimately delivering more value to our users.
