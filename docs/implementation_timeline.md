## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **Integration Complexity**: The integration between the core repository and tier-specific repositories may be more complex than anticipated.
   - Mitigation: Start with a simple integration approach and gradually add complexity.

2. **Performance Issues**: The hardware detection and optimization may not work as expected on all hardware configurations.
   - Mitigation: Test on a variety of hardware configurations and implement fallback mechanisms.

3. **Documentation Gaps**: The documentation may not cover all aspects of the tiered approach.
   - Mitigation: Implement a documentation review process and gather feedback from users.

4. **Testing Coverage**: The testing may not cover all edge cases and scenarios.
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive test plans and conduct thorough testing.

5. **Deployment Issues**: The deployment process may encounter unexpected issues.
   - Mitigation: Test deployments in a staging environment before production.

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a roadmap for implementing the Clary AI tiered approach over a 10-week period. By following this timeline, the team can ensure that all aspects of the tiered approach are implemented successfully, including repository structure, feature flags, model registry, hardware detection, monitoring, and documentation.

The timeline is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments as needed based on progress and feedback. Regular status updates and milestone reviews will help ensure that the project stays on track and meets its objectives.
