# Agentic Orchestration Layer

The Agentic Orchestration Layer is a core component of the Clary AI document processing platform. It provides intelligent workflow management and reasoning capabilities for document processing.

## Overview

The Agentic Orchestration Layer consists of several components:

1. **Workflow Engine**: Manages the document processing workflow, including task scheduling, state management, and error handling.
2. **Reasoning Engine**: Provides LLM-based reasoning capabilities for document understanding and extraction.
3. **Extraction Agent**: Coordinates the document processing workflow and extraction process.

## Components

### Workflow Engine

The Workflow Engine manages the document processing workflow. It creates and executes tasks in a dependency-based order, ensuring that each task has the necessary inputs from previous tasks.

Key features:
- Task creation and scheduling
- Dependency management
- State tracking
- Error handling and recovery

### Reasoning Engine

The Reasoning Engine provides LLM-based reasoning capabilities for document understanding and extraction. It uses a local LLM (Llama 3 or Mistral) to analyze documents, extract information, and validate results.

Key features:
- Document understanding
- Field extraction
- Table extraction
- Validation and correction

### Extraction Agent

The Extraction Agent coordinates the document processing workflow and extraction process. It integrates with the Workflow Engine and Reasoning Engine to provide a complete document processing solution.

Key features:
- Workflow creation and execution
- Template-based extraction
- Confidence scoring
- Result formatting

## Workflow

The document processing workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: Normalize and preprocess the document using Unstructured.io.
2. **Text Extraction**: Extract text from the document using Marker (for PDFs) or OCR (for images).
3. **Layout Analysis**: Analyze the document layout to identify structure, tables, and forms.
4. **Document Understanding**: Use the Reasoning Engine to understand the document type, purpose, and structure.
5. **Field Extraction**: Extract fields from the document based on templates or document understanding.
6. **Table Extraction**: Extract tables from the document based on templates or document understanding.
7. **Validation**: Validate the extraction results and correct errors.
8. **Postprocessing**: Format and finalize the extraction results.

## Implementation

The Agentic Orchestration Layer is implemented in Python using the following technologies:

- **LangChain**: For LLM integration and prompt management
- **Llama 3 / Mistral**: For local LLM-based reasoning
- **FastAPI**: For API integration
- **Asyncio**: For asynchronous processing

## Usage

The Agentic Orchestration Layer is used by the document processing service to extract information from documents. It can be accessed through the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/documents/upload`: Upload a document for processing
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/results`: Get the extraction results for a document
- `GET /api/v1/documents/jobs/{job_id}`: Get the status of a document processing job

## Configuration

The Agentic Orchestration Layer can be configured through the following environment variables:

- `LLM_MODEL`: The LLM model to use for reasoning (default: `llama-3-8b`)
- `MODEL_PATH`: The path to the LLM models (default: `/app/models`)
- `OCR_MODEL`: The OCR model to use for text extraction (default: `tesseract`)
- `LAYOUT_MODEL`: The layout model to use for layout analysis (default: `layoutlm`)

## Future Enhancements

The Agentic Orchestration Layer will be enhanced with the following features in future releases:

1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents working together to process complex documents
2. **Learning from Feedback**: Improving extraction accuracy based on user feedback
3. **Domain-Specific Reasoning**: Specialized reasoning for specific document types and domains
4. **Advanced Validation**: More sophisticated validation and correction mechanisms
5. **Performance Optimization**: Improved processing speed and resource usage

## Conclusion

The Agentic Orchestration Layer is a powerful component of the Clary AI document processing platform, providing intelligent workflow management and reasoning capabilities for document processing. It enables the platform to extract structured information from documents with high accuracy and reliability.
