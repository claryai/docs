# Clary AI: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

Clary AI is a document processing platform that combines the power of open-source AI models with agentic capabilities to intelligently extract, validate, and transform document data. The platform is designed to provide small to medium accounting and legal firms with a cost-effective, privacy-focused solution for document processing that can be self-hosted through Docker containers while requiring API key activation for monetization.

**Vision**: To democratize advanced document processing technology by making it accessible, customizable, and privacy-focused for businesses that handle sensitive documents.

**Goals**:
- Provide a self-hostable Docker solution that gives businesses complete control over their data
- Deliver high-accuracy document extraction for specific document types common in accounting and legal fields
- Offer agentic capabilities that enable multi-step reasoning for complex document processing
- Create a secure architecture that works on-premises with API key activation
- Build a sustainable business model through API key licensing for Docker containers

**Target Market**: Small to medium accounting and legal firms that handle sensitive client documents, need to extract structured data from standard forms, have data privacy concerns, lack resources for expensive enterprise solutions, and process recurring document types.

## 2. Problem Statement

Small to medium accounting and legal firms face significant challenges in document processing:

1. **Data Privacy Concerns**: These firms handle sensitive client information that cannot be processed through public cloud services due to regulatory requirements and client confidentiality.

2. **Resource Constraints**: They lack the budget for expensive enterprise document processing solutions but still need to process large volumes of documents efficiently.

3. **Accuracy Requirements**: Standard OCR solutions often fail to correctly extract structured data from complex documents like invoices, contracts, and tax forms, requiring manual verification and correction.

4. **Integration Needs**: Firms need document processing solutions that integrate with their existing workflows and software systems.

5. **Specialized Document Types**: These firms repeatedly process the same document types (invoices, contracts, tax forms) but existing solutions aren't optimized for these specific formats.

Clary AI addresses these challenges by providing a self-hostable, specialized document processing platform with high accuracy for specific document types, while maintaining data privacy and offering integration capabilities at a price point accessible to smaller firms.
