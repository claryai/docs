# Document Processing

Clary AI's document processing capabilities allow you to extract, analyze, and understand information from various document formats.

## Supported Document Formats

- PDF documents
- Microsoft Word documents (DOCX)
- Plain text files (TXT)
- Images (JPG, PNG)
- Scanned documents
- And more

## Key Features

### Document Parsing

Clary AI can parse documents to extract their structure, text, and embedded elements such as tables, images, and charts.

### OCR Capabilities

For scanned documents or images, Clary AI uses advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text accurately.

### Layout Analysis

Clary AI understands document layouts, including headers, footers, columns, and other structural elements.

### Table Extraction

Tables in documents are automatically identified and extracted in a structured format for further analysis.

### Metadata Extraction

Clary AI can extract metadata from documents, such as author, creation date, and document properties.

## How It Works

1. **Document Upload**: Documents are uploaded to Clary AI through the API
2. **Preprocessing**: Documents are preprocessed to optimize for analysis
3. **Structure Analysis**: The document structure is analyzed to identify key components
4. **Text Extraction**: Text is extracted from the document, including from images via OCR
5. **Post-processing**: Extracted information is cleaned and structured for further use

## Integration with Workflow Engine

The document processing capabilities are tightly integrated with Clary AI's [Workflow Engine](/concepts/workflow-engine/index), allowing you to create automated document processing pipelines.
