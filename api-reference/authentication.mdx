# Authentication

All API requests to Clary AI require authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access your documents and data.

## API Keys

Clary AI uses API keys for authentication. You can generate API keys from the Clary AI web interface under Settings > API Keys.

Each API key has the following properties:
- A unique identifier
- A secret key (shown only once when created)
- Permissions (read, write, admin)
- An optional expiration date

## Using API Keys

To authenticate your API requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer token format:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://your-clary-instance:8080/api/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Do not share them in public repositories or client-side code.
</Warning>

## API Key Permissions

API keys can have different permission levels:

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Read | Can only retrieve data, cannot modify anything |
| Write | Can create and modify resources, but cannot manage users or API keys |
| Admin | Full access to all API endpoints |

## API Key Management

### Creating API Keys

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  https://your-clary-instance:8080/api/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Application Key",
    "permissions": ["read", "write"],
    "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://your-clary-instance:8080/api/v1/api-keys",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer ADMIN_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "name": "My Application Key",
        "permissions": ["read", "write"],
        "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    }
)

print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

### Revoking API Keys

To revoke an API key, make a DELETE request:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  https://your-clary-instance:8080/api/v1/api-keys/KEY_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_API_KEY"
```
