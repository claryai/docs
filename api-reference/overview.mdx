# Clary AI API Overview

The Clary AI API allows you to programmatically interact with the Clary AI platform, enabling you to process documents, manage workflows, and retrieve analysis results.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the base URL of your Clary AI instance:

```
http://your-clary-instance:8080/api/v1
```

If you're using the Docker container with default settings, this would be:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

## Available Endpoints

Clary AI provides the following main API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/documents` | Upload, process, and retrieve documents |
| `/workflows` | Create and manage document processing workflows |
| `/analysis` | Access document analysis results |

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. A typical response structure looks like:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

For error responses:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Error message"
  }
}
```

## Pagination

For endpoints that return multiple items, pagination is supported using the following query parameters:

- `page`: Page number (starting from 1)
- `limit`: Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)

Example:

```
GET /api/v1/documents?page=2&limit=50
```
