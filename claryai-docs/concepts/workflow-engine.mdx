# Workflow Engine

Clary AI's Workflow Engine allows you to automate complex document processing tasks by creating custom workflows. This page explains how the Workflow Engine works and how to use it effectively.

## What is a Workflow?

A workflow in Clary AI is a sequence of processing steps that are applied to documents. Workflows can include:

- Document processing operations (text extraction, table extraction, etc.)
- Conditional logic based on document content or metadata
- Data transformation and enrichment
- Integration with external systems
- Notifications and alerts

Workflows are defined using a simple JSON format and can be created and managed through the Clary AI API or web interface.

## Workflow Components

### Processors

Processors are the building blocks of workflows. Each processor performs a specific operation on a document:

<CodeGroup>
```json Text Extraction
{
  "id": "text-extractor",
  "type": "text-extraction",
  "config": {
    "include_formatting": true,
    "languages": ["en", "fr", "de"]
  }
}
```

```json Table Extraction
{
  "id": "table-extractor",
  "type": "table-extraction",
  "config": {
    "detect_headers": true,
    "max_tables": 10
  }
}
```

```json Entity Recognition
{
  "id": "entity-recognizer",
  "type": "entity-recognition",
  "config": {
    "entities": ["person", "organization", "location", "date"],
    "confidence_threshold": 0.7
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Conditions

Conditions allow you to create branching logic in your workflows:

```json
{
  "id": "document-type-condition",
  "type": "condition",
  "config": {
    "condition": "$.metadata.document_type == 'invoice'",
    "if_true": "invoice-processor",
    "if_false": "general-processor"
  }
}
```

### Transformers

Transformers modify the data extracted from documents:

```json
{
  "id": "date-transformer",
  "type": "transformer",
  "config": {
    "field": "$.metadata.date",
    "transformation": "ISO8601",
    "output_field": "$.metadata.iso_date"
  }
}
```

### Integrations

Integrations allow workflows to connect with external systems:

```json
{
  "id": "crm-integration",
  "type": "integration",
  "config": {
    "type": "webhook",
    "url": "https://your-crm.example.com/api/documents",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {{env.CRM_API_KEY}}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating a Workflow

To create a workflow, you define a sequence of processors and their connections:

<CodeGroup>
```json Simple Workflow
{
  "name": "Basic Document Processing",
  "description": "Extract text and tables from documents",
  "processors": [
    {
      "id": "text-extractor",
      "type": "text-extraction",
      "config": {
        "include_formatting": true
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "table-extractor",
      "type": "table-extraction",
      "config": {
        "detect_headers": true
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "from": "start",
      "to": "text-extractor"
    },
    {
      "from": "text-extractor",
      "to": "table-extractor"
    },
    {
      "from": "table-extractor",
      "to": "end"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Complex Workflow
{
  "name": "Invoice Processing",
  "description": "Process invoices and extract key information",
  "processors": [
    {
      "id": "document-classifier",
      "type": "document-classification",
      "config": {
        "types": ["invoice", "receipt", "other"]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "invoice-condition",
      "type": "condition",
      "config": {
        "condition": "$.classification.type == 'invoice'",
        "if_true": "invoice-extractor",
        "if_false": "general-extractor"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "invoice-extractor",
      "type": "invoice-extraction",
      "config": {
        "extract_fields": ["invoice_number", "date", "total", "vendor"]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "general-extractor",
      "type": "text-extraction",
      "config": {
        "include_formatting": true
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "data-validator",
      "type": "data-validation",
      "config": {
        "rules": [
          "$.invoice.total > 0",
          "$.invoice.date is valid date"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "crm-integration",
      "type": "integration",
      "config": {
        "type": "webhook",
        "url": "https://your-crm.example.com/api/invoices",
        "method": "POST"
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "from": "start",
      "to": "document-classifier"
    },
    {
      "from": "document-classifier",
      "to": "invoice-condition"
    },
    {
      "from": "invoice-condition",
      "to": "invoice-extractor",
      "condition": "true"
    },
    {
      "from": "invoice-condition",
      "to": "general-extractor",
      "condition": "false"
    },
    {
      "from": "invoice-extractor",
      "to": "data-validator"
    },
    {
      "from": "data-validator",
      "to": "crm-integration"
    },
    {
      "from": "crm-integration",
      "to": "end"
    },
    {
      "from": "general-extractor",
      "to": "end"
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Workflow Templates

Clary AI provides pre-built workflow templates for common document processing tasks:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Invoice Processing" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
    Extract key information from invoices, including invoice number, date, total amount, and line items.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resume Parsing" icon="user-tie">
    Extract candidate information from resumes, including contact details, education, work experience, and skills.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contract Analysis" icon="file-contract">
    Extract key clauses, parties, dates, and obligations from legal contracts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Form Processing" icon="wpforms">
    Extract field values from structured forms and convert them to structured data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Workflow Execution

When a document is processed using a workflow, Clary AI:

1. Executes each processor in the defined sequence
2. Evaluates conditions to determine the processing path
3. Applies transformations to the extracted data
4. Triggers integrations with external systems
5. Returns the processed results

You can monitor workflow execution through the Clary AI API or web interface, including:
- Current status of each document
- Processing time for each step
- Errors or warnings that occurred during processing
- Final results and outputs

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic workflows and add complexity as needed.

2. **Test thoroughly**: Test your workflows with a variety of documents to ensure they handle different cases correctly.

3. **Use conditions wisely**: Use conditions to create different processing paths for different document types or content.

4. **Monitor performance**: Keep an eye on workflow execution times and optimize as needed.

5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Configure error handling to ensure your workflows are resilient.

6. **Document your workflows**: Add clear names and descriptions to your workflows and processors.
