# AI Models

Clary AI leverages various AI models to enhance document processing capabilities. This page explains the AI models used in Clary AI and how they improve document understanding.

## AI Model Integration

Clary AI's approach to AI model integration varies by tier:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Lite">
    The Lite tier does not include pre-integrated AI models. However, it provides a flexible architecture that allows you to integrate your own AI models through the API.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Standard">
    The Standard tier includes Phi-4 Multimodal, a powerful open-source AI model that provides advanced document understanding capabilities without requiring cloud connectivity.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Professional">
    The Professional tier includes cloud LLM connections, allowing you to leverage state-of-the-art AI models for the most advanced document understanding capabilities.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Phi-4 Multimodal (Standard Tier)

The Standard tier of Clary AI includes Microsoft's Phi-4 Multimodal model, a powerful open-source AI model that can understand both text and images.

### Key Capabilities

- **Text Understanding**: Comprehend document content, extract key information, and answer questions about the document.
- **Image Analysis**: Analyze images within documents, identify objects, and extract text from images.
- **Multimodal Reasoning**: Combine understanding of text and images to provide comprehensive document analysis.
- **Local Processing**: All processing happens locally, ensuring data privacy and reducing latency.

### Technical Specifications

- **Model Size**: 4.8 billion parameters
- **Context Window**: 8,192 tokens
- **Input Formats**: Text and images
- **Hardware Requirements**: 
  - Minimum: 8GB RAM, 4-core CPU
  - Recommended: 16GB RAM, 8-core CPU, GPU with 8GB VRAM

### Use Cases

- **Document Classification**: Automatically categorize documents based on their content.
- **Information Extraction**: Extract specific information from documents, such as names, dates, and amounts.
- **Document Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of document content.
- **Question Answering**: Answer specific questions about document content.

## Cloud LLM Connections (Professional Tier)

The Professional tier of Clary AI includes connections to cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs), providing the most advanced document understanding capabilities.

### Supported Cloud LLMs

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="OpenAI GPT-4" icon="openai">
    State-of-the-art language model with advanced reasoning capabilities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Anthropic Claude" icon="robot">
    Powerful language model with strong understanding of complex documents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google Gemini" icon="google">
    Advanced multimodal model with strong document understanding capabilities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Key Capabilities

- **Advanced Reasoning**: Understand complex documents and extract nuanced information.
- **Zero-Shot Learning**: Process new document types without specific training.
- **Chain-of-Thought Processing**: Break down complex document analysis into logical steps.
- **Multimodal Understanding**: Process text, tables, and images with integrated understanding.

### Configuration Options

You can configure which cloud LLM to use and how to use it:

```json
{
  "cloud_llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "api_key": "{{env.OPENAI_API_KEY}}",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "max_tokens": 1000
  }
}
```

### Cost Management

The Professional tier includes features to help manage the cost of cloud LLM usage:

- **Caching**: Cache responses to avoid redundant API calls.
- **Rate Limiting**: Set limits on the number of API calls.
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and report on API usage and costs.
- **Fallback Options**: Configure fallback to local models when appropriate.

## Custom Model Integration

All tiers of Clary AI allow you to integrate your own AI models:

### Integration Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Integration">
    Integrate external AI models through REST API calls:
    
    ```json
    {
      "custom_model": {
        "type": "api",
        "url": "https://your-model-api.example.com/predict",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer {{env.MODEL_API_KEY}}"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Container Integration">
    Deploy your models as containers that can be integrated with Clary AI:
    
    ```json
    {
      "custom_model": {
        "type": "container",
        "image": "your-org/your-model:latest",
        "port": 8000,
        "environment": {
          "MODEL_CONFIG": "path/to/config.json"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python Integration">
    Integrate Python-based models directly:
    
    ```json
    {
      "custom_model": {
        "type": "python",
        "module": "your_model_module",
        "class": "YourModelClass",
        "init_args": {
          "model_path": "path/to/model.pt"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Model Selection and Fallback

Clary AI allows you to configure model selection and fallback strategies:

```json
{
  "model_selection": {
    "default": "phi-4-multimodal",
    "document_types": {
      "invoice": "cloud-llm",
      "receipt": "custom-receipt-model",
      "general": "phi-4-multimodal"
    },
    "fallback": {
      "cloud-llm": "phi-4-multimodal",
      "phi-4-multimodal": "basic-extraction"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the right model for the task**: Different models excel at different tasks. Choose the appropriate model based on your document processing needs.

2. **Optimize prompts**: When using LLMs, craft clear and specific prompts to get the best results.

3. **Implement caching**: Cache model responses to improve performance and reduce costs.

4. **Monitor performance**: Regularly evaluate model performance and adjust as needed.

5. **Consider privacy requirements**: Choose local models for sensitive documents if data privacy is a concern.

6. **Test with diverse documents**: Ensure your models work well with a variety of document types and formats.
