<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Text Understanding">
    Phi-4 can comprehend document content, extract key information, and answer questions about the document:
    
    ```json
    {
      "query": "What is the total amount of this invoice?",
      "context": "Invoice #12345\nDate: 2024-05-15\nCustomer: Acme Corp\nTotal: $1,250.00",
      "response": "The total amount of this invoice is $1,250.00."
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Image Analysis">
    Phi-4 can analyze images within documents, identify objects, and extract text from images:
    
    ```json
    {
      "query": "What does this chart show?",
      "image": "base64_encoded_image",
      "response": "The chart shows quarterly sales figures for 2023, with Q3 having the highest sales at $1.2M."
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multimodal Reasoning">
    Phi-4 can combine understanding of text and images to provide comprehensive document analysis:
    
    ```json
    {
      "query": "Does the data in the table match the chart?",
      "context": "Q1: $0.8M, Q2: $0.9M, Q3: $1.2M, Q4: $1.0M",
      "image": "base64_encoded_chart_image",
      "response": "Yes, the data in the table matches the chart. Both show quarterly sales with Q3 having the highest value at $1.2M."
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
